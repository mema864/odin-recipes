    <h2>Egg in a Hole
    </h2>
    <p>A delicious runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a slightly different way. My kids feel fancy when eating these</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons bacon grease</li>
        <li>1 slice bread</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>Melt the bacon grease in a non-stick pan over low heat.</li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Cut a 1 1/2 to 2-inch hole from the center of the bread slice; lay in the hot skillet. When the side facing down is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole; season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the egg is cooked and mostly firm. Flip again and cook 1 minute more to assure doneness on both sides. Serve immediately.</li>
        
    </ol>
